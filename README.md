# Recommended locations

Using neo4j, generate and seed 10M locations, 1M users, and 17M relationships to mock a TripAdvisor recommended locations page at scale.

Query times are under 60 ms, and a fully Dockerized version of the full-stack page can handle 1000 RPS with a 0% error rate and 100ms average response time.
